During my summer internship I developed a WeChat Mini Program written using JavaScript and wxml as part of the Ô¨Årst global WeChat Developer Challenge in Singapore. 

The application aims to increase post arrival expenses of Chinese tourists in Resort World Sentosa. Tourists can interactively navigate the resort, book hotels and tickets in advance, scan QR codes instead of physical tickets and much more... allowing for a truly immersive and seamless experience for tourists. 

To view the mini program, scan the QR code in the WeChat app
